# CodexBook

CodexBook is an AI-assisted writing platform designed for authors who seek to structure, revise, and expand narrative universes with symbolic depth and textual consistency. Unlike tools that generate stories automatically, CodexBook begins with a human narrative and acts as an editorial orchestrator.

## Overview
The project was born out of the need to create a complete and coherent ecosystem within the OpenAI environment, avoiding dependency on third-party tools. Its architecture combines:
- **Django** for backend
- **HTMX** for dynamic interactions and responsiveness
- **Bootstrap 5** for a clean, responsive UI
- Integration with **GPT-4.5** and **Codex CLI** for contextual assistance

## Objectives
- Preserve the author's original voice and style
- Analyze symbolic and structural coherence across text blocks
- Use styleguides, manifestos, and glossaries as guidance layers for the AI
- Enable connection with external narrative repositories

## Related Repositories
This repository works in tandem with a complementary repository, where a manuscript is being developed as a test base for CodexBook. It provides the narrative data with which the platform interacts.

## Next Steps
- Refactor the editing interface to support block-based writing and semantic versioning  
- Finalize styleguide integration for real-time feedback during writing  
- Enable dynamic translation workflows between English and Portuguese with GPT-4.5  
- Prepare CodexBook for first public release under an open source license  
- Integrate external narrative repositories (e.g., the manuscript repo) as modular content sources  
- Begin Sora experimentation phase  

## Planned Use of Sora
As Sora capabilities mature, CodexBook will use it to:
- Simulate different reader agents (philosophical, emotional, analytical) responding to narrative excerpts  
- Generate visual scenes and atmospheres for symbolic validation  
- Allow authors to test the interpretative range of their narrative through AI-driven narrative simulation  
- Assist in cross-modal coherence by correlating imagery with emotional and vibrational tone in the text  

## License
The project will be released as open source soon. Currently under internal development.

**Note:** CodexBook is not an automatic book generator. It is an orchestrator of universes created by human minds, aided by intelligences that respect symbolic fields and creative intentionality.
