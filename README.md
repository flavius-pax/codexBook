# codexBook
CodexBook is an AI-assisted writing platform designed for authors who seek to structure, revise, and expand narrative universes with symbolic depth and textual consistency. Unlike tools that generate stories automatically, CodexBook begins with a human narrative and acts as an editorial orchestrator.
